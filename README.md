# Welcome

## What is this

Args plus is a command handler made for the [discord.js library][discord.js]

## What can args plus do

Args plus has the ability to do many things, such as:
<br />

-   Load message commands and slash commands with the same run method (Ie you only need to write the code once per command for slash and message commands)
-   Intergrated discord.js V13 and typescript
-   Intergrated MongoDB with mongoose
-   wide settings of customisibility (for example you can get the bot to send embeds or regular text messages by default)
-   Reduces repeititie code with the argument or "args" system. This is because you can look for things like channel mentions (which will look for mention or channel ID) and things like that
-   The abilitiy to load "configurations", which are settings stored on mongoDB, and cached on startup
-   Great built in commands
